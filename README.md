# Unassigned-Branch-Determiner

A brute force calculation program which aims to identify the quantum numbers of an unassigned branch.
It reads in ground state energies for the molecule from an Excel file and then uses these along with
the approiate selection rules in order to see which quantum numbers give the best results. The output
is filtered (based on user input) as to give only the best possible results.
