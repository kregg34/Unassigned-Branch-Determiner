# Unassigned-Branch-Determiner

This program is used for combination difference checking of branches belonging to asymmetric top molecules.

This program uses brute force to try and identify the quantum numbers of an unassigned branch.
It reads in ground state energies for the molecule from an Excel file and then uses these along with
the approiate selection rules in order to see which quantum numbers give the best results. The output
is filtered (based on user input) as to give only the best possible results.
